# videototext
## Transcribe videos to text.
<p>This tool uses python libraries to turn a youtube video into an audio file. Then process the audio through IBM Watson API to extratc a transcript.</p>
<p>[You can visit a working demo here](http://107.170.46.214/)</p>
<small>We are working on a new version that allows simultaneous requests to IBM Watson via websocket to speed up the process and allow working with longest videos. Eventually also in streaming.</small>
